# Error Detection API - Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

Implemented a minimal AI-powered error detection API for educational platforms using OpenAI's GPT-4o Vision and GPT-4 text models. The system achieves baseline functionality with structured evaluation comparing simple vs enhanced prompting approaches.

## Key Assumptions

### Problem Framing
- **Mathematical Focus**: Primarily algebra, arithmetic, and basic calculus problems
- **Step-level Analysis**: Detect errors in individual solution steps, not just final answers
- **Educational Context**: Provide helpful feedback (error + correction + hint) vs binary classification
- **Image Quality**: Assume reasonably clear handwritten or typed mathematical content

### Technical Assumptions
- **Image Access**: Public URLs accessible within 30s timeout
- **Content Type**: Text-based math with occasional diagrams/graphs
- **Scale**: Educational platform with moderate concurrent usage (≤5 RPS)
- **Latency Tolerance**: 10s P95 acceptable for non-real-time feedback

### Business Assumptions
- **Cost Sensitivity**: $0.03/request acceptable for educational SaaS
- **Accuracy vs Speed**: Prefer higher quality analysis over sub-second response
- **MVP Scope**: File-based storage and simple auth sufficient for initial deployment

## Design Choices & Rationale

### 1. Architecture: OCR + LLM Pipeline
**Decision**: OpenAI Vision API → GPT-4 text analysis
**Rationale**: 
- Leverages state-of-the-art vision and language models
- Faster development vs training custom models
- High accuracy on mathematical content
**Trade-off**: Higher cost and external dependency vs quality

### 2. Baseline vs Improved Approach
**Baseline**: Simple OCR + basic prompt ("Check this math solution for errors")
**Improved**: Structured prompting + context + error categorization
- Enhanced prompt with error type taxonomy
- Question context for better analysis
- Structured response parsing
**Hypothesis**: Better prompting improves accuracy by 10-20%

### 3. Evaluation Dataset
**Approach**: Curated 5 test cases with step-level labels
- Mix of correct/incorrect solutions
- Different error types (algebraic, arithmetic, conceptual)
- 2 noisy cases for robustness testing
**Limitation**: Small dataset, would need 50+ cases for production

### 4. Infrastructure Choices
**Storage**: File-based JSON for audit trails
**Auth**: Simple API key (not OAuth/JWT)
**Concurrency**: Asyncio semaphore (not Redis/queue)
**Rationale**: Minimal viable implementation, easy to deploy and test
